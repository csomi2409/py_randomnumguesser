# Random number guesser in Python | Created by Bence Csomor
Contains 1 program (main.py)

The ``main.py`` program generates a random integer between a given range and the user tries to guess it.
Used 1 module [random] 

The program runs continuously. It only stops, after the user guessed the correct number.

I handled the ValueError - users cannot input letters.

Source code contains comments.
